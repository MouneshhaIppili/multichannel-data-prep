**Multichannel Data Preparation for Insomnia Detection**

This Jupyter Notebook (`multichanneldatapreparation.ipynb`) implements essential multichannel data preparation steps tied to your published work on insomnia detection using CNN-based models.



🧠 Related Research

The underlying methodology and goals align with published studies in insomnia detection, such as:

- *“A double-layered fully automated insomnia identification model…”* which uses single-channel EEG and data augmentation techniques to achieve ~94% accuracy using Random Forest classifiers :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

Your notebook extends this research by focusing on **multichannel sensor data**, aiming to improve signal richness and model robustness.
